# Pylates, a SaaS Development Platform ðŸš§


### Think of it as Wordpress for SaaS
Guided by our *[Slender Stack](slenderstack.com)* philosophy, we're removing technical hurdles to unleash the next wave of founders.

### Product Focused
Our goal is to help solopreneurs, indie hackers, bootstrappers, etc. go from idea to first customer in a weekend.

### Low-Code Python
This is an opinionated stack powered by [Hyperdiv](https://hyperdiv.io) to vastly reduce boilerplate.

### Batteries Included
We've purposefully integrated services that enable launching quickly without sacrificing scalability.
- Xata (db)
- Kinde (auth)
- Dispatch (background tasks)
- Stripe (payments)
- Resend (email)
- Fly.io (hosting)
- *others TBD* (We're open to contributions!)

### Inspirations
- The classics like Flask, Django, RoR, Laravel
- Full stack JS like Next, Sveltekit
- Full stack Python like [Anvil](anvil.works), Reflex
- Other interesting things like Wasp

**We're shooting for an alpha release in Q4 2024**
